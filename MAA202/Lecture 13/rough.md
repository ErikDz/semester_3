The Maclaurin series for $\frac{1}{1-x}$ is
$$\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \cdots$$
so to find $\sum_{k\ge0}x^{2k}$, we need to look at the terms of the series that have even powers of $x$. These are the terms $1$, $x^2$, $x^4$, $x^6$, $\dots$. So we can write:
$$\sum_{k\ge0}x^{2k} = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-x^2}$$
Note that this is the geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio $x^2$.
