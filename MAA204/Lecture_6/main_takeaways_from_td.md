Confidence intervals, defined as $\mathbb{P}[\hat{\theta}\in(L,U)]=1-\alpha$ actually make reference to the quantiles (of the estimator!). Thus when we use the CTL to get the $N(0,1)$ approximation, we use the critical values of the normal distribution which are actually the quantiles of the normal distrbution. i.e.,
$$L=\text{The lower quantile }$$
$$L=\text{The upper quantile }$$
(of the distribution we are looking at)

Now, that is on single-tailed tests, on double-tailed tests, we take the $\alpha/2$ quantile of the distribuiton we are working with bc both tails will add up in total the value of $\alpha$ which was what was specified.
