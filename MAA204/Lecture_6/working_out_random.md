The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are independently and identically distributed random variables with finite mean and variance, then the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to the population variance divided by the sample size.

In this case, the estimator we are considering is $\frac{1}{1+\bar{X}}$. Since $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean of the random variable $X$, we know that its expectation and variance are given by the population mean and variance of $X$, respectively.

Now to apply the CLT, we note that for large sample size n, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean of $(1-p)p^{-1}$ and variance of $(1-p)p^{-2}/n$. So, by plugging the mean and variance of $\bar{X}$ in the estimator we get the asymptotic distribution of the estimator.

So, $\frac{1}{1+((1-p)p^{-1} + \frac{(1-p)p^{-2}}{\sqrt n}Z )}$ where Z is standard normal.

Therefore, as sample size n increases, the estimator $\frac{1}{1+\bar{X}}$ will converge in distribution to a normal distribution with mean $\frac{1}{1+(1-p)p^{-1}}$ and variance $\frac{(1-p)p^{-2}}{n(1+(1-p)p^{-1})^2}$

Yes, we can use the delta method to make the estimator converge to a standard normal distribution. The delta method states that if $g(x)$ is a differentiable function and $X_n$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then $g(X_n)$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean $g(\mu)$ and variance $\sigma^2g'(\mu)^2$.

We have the expectation and variance of $\bar{X}$ and we can use that to find that
$g(x) = \frac{1}{1+x}$, $g'(x) = -\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}$

Let's find $g(\mu)$ and $\sigma^2g'(\mu)^2$

$g(\mu) = \frac{1}{1+((1-p)p^{-1})}$, $\sigma^2g'(\mu)^2 = \frac{(1-p)p^{-2}}{n(1+(1-p)p^{-1})^4}$

so the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is
$\frac{1}{1+((1-p)p^{-1} + \frac{(1-p)p^{-2}}{\sqrt n}Z )}$, where Z is standard normal
$= \frac{1}{1+((1-p)p^{-1})} + \frac{-\frac{(1-p)p^{-2}}{(1+(1-p)p^{-1})^2}}{\sqrt n}Z$
$=g(\mu) + \sigma^2 g'(\mu) \frac{Z}{\sqrt n} $

Where Z is standard normal.
Therefore as sample size n increases, the estimator converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution.
