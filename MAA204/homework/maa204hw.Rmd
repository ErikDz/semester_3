This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Question 12.

$R$ is given as $$R = \sqrt{-2\log(U)}$$ where $U$ follow a uniform distribution on [0, 1]

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\bigl[R \leq x\bigr] & = \mathbb{P}\bigl[-2 \log(U) \leq x^2\bigr] = \\
& = \mathbb{P}\bigl[\log(U) \geq -\frac{x^2}{2}\bigr] = \\
& = 1 - \mathbb{P}\biggl[U < \exp\Bigl(-\frac{x^2}{2}\Bigr)\biggr]\, .
\end{align*}$$

$U$ is a random variable from uniform distribution on [0, 1], so 

$$\mathbb{P}[R \leq x] = 1 - \int_{0}^{\exp(-x^2/2)}  \,dx = 1 - \exp(\frac{-x^2}{2}) $$
Hence, $$F_R(x) =  1 - \exp(\frac{-x^2}{2})$$
We can obtain the density by taking the derivative of the CDF as it is differentiable on the interval we the problem is defined on. Thus we have
$$f_R(x) = \exp(\frac{-x^2}{2})*x $$ for $x > 0$.

Question 13.

Let $V = 2\pi\Theta$. As $V$ is uniformly distributed on [0, 1] it immidiately follows that the density function is $$f_V(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}$$.

Since $U$ and $V$ are independent the joint density is
$$f_{R, \Theta}(x_1, x_2) = f_R(x_1) f_\Theta(x_2) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{x_1^2}{2}\Bigr)\cdot x_1 \, .$$

Question 14.

Let $(a,b) = g(R, \theta) = (R\cos(\theta),R\sin(\theta))$. Meaning, we have 
$$\begin{cases}
      a = R\cos(\theta)\\
      b = R\sin(\theta)
    \end{cases}\
$$

Using $\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$, we have $$R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$.

Question 15.

FIRST QUESTION IS TBD

$$ \begin{align*}
f_{X, Y}(a, b) = \frac{f_{R, \theta}(g^{-1}(a, b))}{r} &= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\Bigr) \\ 
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{a^2}{2}\Bigr) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{b^2}{2}\Bigr)
\end{align*}$$

We used $$R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
Question 16.

Notice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{a^2}{2}\Bigr) = f_X(a)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Bigl(-\frac{b^2}{2}\Bigr) = f_Y(b)$, hence we can conclude that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.
Furthermore, from their density functions we can see that both N(0,1) distributed.

# Generate 3000 samples of U and V i.i.d. following a uniform law in [0,1]

X <- sqrt(-2*log(U))*cos(2*pi*V)
Y <- sqrt(-2*log(U))*sin(2*pi*V)

#plot the histogram of X and Y
hist(X, freq = F, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(0, 0.5), main = "Histogram of X and Y", xlab = "x", ylab = "density")
